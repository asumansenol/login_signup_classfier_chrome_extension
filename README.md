# Login Signup Classifier - Chrome Extension üîê
This Chrome extension is designed to classify a webpage as either a login or signup page. In contrast to traditional approaches, it uses a machine learning model with 98% recall and precision. The model was designed to classify various styles of login and signup forms by analyzing [89 different features](https://github.com/asumansenol/login_signup_classfier_chrome_extension/blob/main/dist/register_login_feature_extraction/register_login_signals.js). This ensures the classifier's effectiveness in identifying login and signup pages, including those with multi-step authentication processes. [The model](https://github.com/asumansenol/login_signup_classfier_chrome_extension/tree/main/dist/model) was developed by using Tensorflow to use in the web browser and in Node.js.


üìñ This work is part of an [academic paper](https://cosicdatabase.esat.kuleuven.be/backend/publications/files/conferencepaper/3756). For a more detailed overview visit the [main repository](https://github.com/asumansenol/double_edged_sword_crawler/tree/main/).


## How does it work?

1. Upon each page load, the content script sends login and signup signals from the page and its iframes to the service worker (background.js).
2. The background script forwards these signals to the LoginSignupPageClassifier for page type identification.
3. If the classifier detects a Login or Signup Page, the popup.js is dynamically updated to display the result on the user interface.
